**Company Knowledge Base Master File:**

**1. About the Company**

* **Our Philosophy:** At Cambridge Bespoke, we believe in timeless design, honest materials, and uncompromising craftsmanship. Every kitchen and cabinetry piece is made with the conviction that beauty and functionality should be attainable without inflated costs. We aim to bridge the gap between bespoke quality and fair pricing.
* **Our Story:** Cambridge Bespoke was founded to solve a common frustration—clients seeking exceptional cabinetry often faced extortionate prices or subpar finishes. With over 20 years’ experience in the luxury cabinetry industry, we built Cambridge Bespoke to offer kitchens and interiors that reflect the standards of renowned British makers, at a more accessible level. Our team’s background includes collaborations with top-tier kitchen and furniture brands.
* **What Makes Us Different:** We offer handcrafted, in-frame cabinetry made with traditional joinery techniques. We provide a choice of solid tulipwood, oak, or MDF, depending on needs and budget. We use hand-painted finishes in timeless heritage tones and provide 3D renderings before any site visits or quotes. We are committed to no inflated pricing or unnecessary upsells—just honest craftsmanship at fair value. We also offer trade-friendly services with flexible cabinetry options.
* **Our Clients:** We proudly serve both private homeowners seeking bespoke kitchens or full interior cabinetry, and trade professionals, including interior designers, architects, developers, and kitchen fitters.

**2. Products & Services**

* **Full Bespoke Kitchens:** Our bespoke kitchens are tailored to your exact needs. We build cabinetry using traditional in-frame techniques, dovetailed solid wood drawers, and premium hardware. Clients can customise everything—from cabinetry paint colour and handles to worktops and internal configurations.
* **Micro-Luxury Kitchens:** A curated, semi-bespoke cabinetry concept that blends the elegance of bespoke design with a more accessible format. Tailored for compact city homes or second residences, they maintain high-end detailing like in-frame joinery and hand-painted finishes, but with pre-configured layouts for quicker delivery and clearer pricing.
* **Other Cabinetry:**
    * **Bathroom Vanities:** Built to suit traditional or modern bathrooms, including integrated stone basins, painted tulipwood, or fully waterproofed MDF finishes.
    * **Wardrobes & Dressing Rooms:** Bespoke wardrobes in hinged or sliding form, available with fitted interiors for shelving, hanging rails, and drawers.
    * **Libraries & Home Offices:** Wall-to-wall cabinetry with open shelving, ladder systems, or integrated desks.
    * **Freestanding Furniture:** Sideboards, dressers, boot room benches, and wine cabinets built with the same detailing as our fitted cabinetry.
* **Other Products:** We offer hand-painted artisan tiles through collaborations with UK-based ceramicists, and design packages for visualisation for both private and trade clients.

**3. Our Process (Step-by-Step)**

* **Step 1: Initial Consultation:** A free phone call to discuss your needs. Clients can send photos, sketches, or plans to begin.
* **Step 2: Design Development:** We create a 3D visual render of your proposed design, including style, colour, and layout options.
* **Step 3: Material Selection:** You’ll choose from a curated range of materials including cabinet wood (tulipwood, oak, MDF), paint colours, worktop materials (stone, quartz, marble), and hardware finishes.
* **Step 4: Crafting & Production:** All cabinetry is made in the UK by specialist joiners. Delivery lead time is typically 4–6 weeks from sign-off.
* **Step 5: Installation:** For private clients, we may provide installation or recommend trusted fitters. For trade clients, cabinetry is supply-only.
* **Step 6: Aftercare:** We do not advertise a formal warranty, but clients are encouraged to contact us directly for aftercare advice.

**4. Materials & Finishes**

* **Cabinetry Wood:** Tulipwood (for painted frames), Oak (for exposed interiors), and MDF (cost-effective and stable for painted finishes).
* **Worktops:** Quartz, Marble, Granite, Corian, Natural Wood, and others available upon request.
* **Hardware:** Premium fittings available in Antique Brass, Polished Nickel, Aged Bronze, Matte Black, and unlacquered finishes.
* **Paint & Finishes:** Cabinetry can be primed or topcoated, and hand-painted in our workshop or on-site. We can colour-match to most major brands like Farrow & Ball or Little Greene.

**5. Practical Information**

* **Lead Times:** 4–6 weeks from design approval to delivery.
* **Pricing:** Typical ranges for units and worktops are: Small Kitchen from £7,500, Medium Kitchen approx. £15,000, Large Kitchen from £25,000+. Pricing varies based on materials and complexity.
* **Service Areas:** We serve London, Cambridge, the Home Counties, and France, with select UK and international locations on request.
* **Showroom:** We do not have a physical showroom. All consultations and presentations are virtual or conducted on-site after the 3D render is approved.
