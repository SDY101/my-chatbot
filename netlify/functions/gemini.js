**Company Knowledge Base Master File:**

**1. About the Company**
* **Our Philosophy:** At Cambridge Bespoke, we believe in timeless design, honest materials, and uncompromising craftsmanship. Every kitchen and cabinetry piece is made with the conviction that beauty and functionality should be attainable without inflated costs. We aim to bridge the gap between bespoke quality and fair pricing.
* **Our Story:** Cambridge Bespoke was founded to solve a common frustration—clients seeking exceptional cabinetry often faced extortionate prices or subpar finishes. With over 20 years’ experience in the luxury cabinetry industry, we built Cambridge Bespoke to offer kitchens and interiors that reflect the standards of renowned British makers, at a more accessible level. Our team’s background includes collaborations with top-tier kitchen and furniture brands.
* **What Makes Us Different:** We offer handcrafted, in-frame cabinetry made with traditional joinery techniques. We provide a choice of solid tulipwood, oak, or MDF, depending on needs and budget. We use hand-painted finishes in timeless heritage tones and provide 3D renderings before any site visits or quotes. We are committed to no inflated pricing or unnecessary upsells—just honest craftsmanship at fair value. We also offer trade-friendly services with flexible cabinetry options.
* **Our Clients:** We proudly serve both private homeowners seeking bespoke kitchens or full interior cabinetry, and trade professionals, including interior designers, architects, developers, and kitchen fitters.

**2. Products & Services**
* **Full Bespoke Kitchens:** Our bespoke kitchens are tailored to your exact needs. We build cabinetry using traditional in-frame techniques, dovetailed solid wood drawers, and premium hardware. Clients can customise everything—from cabinetry paint colour and handles to worktops and internal configurations.
* **Micro-Luxury Kitchens:** A curated, semi-bespoke cabinetry concept that blends the elegance of bespoke design with a more accessible format. Tailored for compact city homes or second residences, they maintain high-end detailing like in-frame joinery and hand-painted finishes, but with pre-configured layouts for quicker delivery and clearer pricing.
* **Other Cabinetry:** Bathroom Vanities, Wardrobes & Dressing Rooms, Libraries & Home Offices, and Freestanding Furniture.
* **Other Products:** We offer hand-painted artisan tiles and design packages for visualisation.

**3. Our Process (Step-by-Step)**
* **1. Initial Consultation:** A free phone call to discuss needs.
* **2. Design Development:** We create a 3D visual render.
* **3. Material Selection:** Clients choose wood, paint, worktops, and hardware.
* **4. Crafting & Production:** Made in the UK by specialist joiners. Lead time is 4–6 weeks.
* **5. Installation:** We can provide installation or recommend fitters. Trade clients receive supply-only.
* **6. Aftercare:** We encourage clients to contact us directly for advice.

**4. Materials & Finishes**
* **Cabinetry Wood:** Tulipwood, Oak, MDF.
* **Worktops:** Quartz, Marble, Granite, Corian, Natural Wood.
* **Hardware:** Antique Brass, Polished Nickel, Aged Bronze, Matte Black, and unlacquered finishes.
* **Paint & Finishes:** Can be primed or topcoated, hand-painted, and colour-matched.

**5. Practical Information**
* **Lead Times:** 4–6 weeks from design approval.
* **Pricing:** Starts from £7,500 for a small kitchen, but projects are quoted individually.
* **Service Areas:** London, Cambridge, the Home Counties, France, and select international locations.
* **Showroom:** We do not have a physical showroom; consultations are virtual or on-site.
